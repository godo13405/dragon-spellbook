# Dragon Spellbook
This is a hook for a chatbot built on Dialogflow that looksup information about D&D 5e.

You can play around with it in this [demo](https://nodejs-mongo-persistent-dragon-book.193b.starter-ca-central-1.openshiftapps.com/).

# Functionality
You can ask it about a lot of things. It even understands context from one question to the next. So if you ask it **what is Fireball** and then **what damage does it do** it will tell you what damage Fireball does.

Here are some samples of what you can ask and the responses you should get. Bear in mind these are just examples, as some of the phrases are randomised.

## Spells
- **what is fireball**
  > Fireball is a 3rd-level evocation that does 8d6 fire damage
- **what damage does it do**
  > Fireball does 8d6 fire damage
- **how long does levitate last**
  > Levitate lasts for up to 10 minutes
- **what school is mage hand**
  > Mage Hand is from the School of conjuration
- **what level is finger of death**
  > Finger of Death is Level 7
- **describe magic missile**
  > You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
- **who can cast thaumaturgy**
  > Thaumaturgy can be cast by clerics only
- **how long does cure wounds take to cast**
  > Cure Wounds takes 1 action to cast

## Conditions

  > a creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
